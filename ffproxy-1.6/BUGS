I've access to a limited number of different
systems only, so it's not guaranteed that
ffproxy will compile or work at all.

So far, I've tested ffproxy to work under
OpenBSD (x86), NetBSD (x86), FreeBSD (x86),
Linux (x86) and Solaris9 (sparc)
(compiled with gcc).

If you've patches to make ffproxy work
on other systems, or if you've success stories,
please let me know.

Version 1.6
============

* added CONNECT request method to
  support HTTPS proxying
  (see section HTTPS OPERATION
   in ffproxy(8))

* new configuration options
  unrestriced_connect and
  timeout_connect

* updated documentation accordingly

* now using autoconf configure scripts
  with new enhanced Makefile targets,
  see file INSTALL

* fixed compiler warnings for some OSes

* removed (unportable) `char - '0'' hacks
  to parse some numbers in http.c and
  introduced numbers.c

* now using freshmeat.net's project
  description in README and manpages

* updated file BUGS

Version 1.5.1
=============

 * allow transparent operation
   (see section TRANSPARENT OPERATION
    in ffproxy(8) or ffproxy.quick(7))

 * allow client to proxy keep alive
   connections

 * new configuration option use_keep_alive

 * updated documentation accordingly

Version 1.5
===========

 * IPv6 bind() support

 * changed db/*
   You'll perhaps need to update files,
   also please take a look at ffproxy(8)

 * allow comments and empty lines in db/*

 * removed caching complety from code

 * changed debug() to macro DEBUG()

 * code cleanups

 * check on configuration errors

 * more documentation in manual pages
   ffproxy(8), ffproxy.conf(5), ffproxy.quick(7)
 
 * added HTTP Accelerator feature

 * more configuration file options,
   more command line options
   (for IPv6 and HTTP Accelerator)

 * allow non-numerical arguments to
   uid, gid, -u, and -g

 * more minor changes

 * allow ffproxy to be compiled under Solaris8

Version 1.4.1
=============

* HTTP fix:  savannah.gnu.org (and possibly
             other hosts) does not understand
             a Host: header with port number
             correctly.
  Now :80 is omitted, port number is only added
  if needed.

* implemented SYSCONFDIR and DATADIR,
  default location for ffproxy's working directory
  (db/ and html/ path) is now /var/ffproxy
  default location of ffproxy.conf is now
  /etc/ffproxy.conf

Version 1.4
===========

* added IPv6 Support
  * new config options
     - use_ipv6 yes|no
     - forward_proxy_ipv6 yes|no
  * new command line option -4 (disable IPv6)
  * PLEASE NOTE:  ffproxy is not yet able to *bind*
    to IPv6, this will be implemented soon after
    this release

* removed config.proxyip and added config.proxyhost:
  now proxyhost is resolved on every access
  (was resolved only once on startup before)

* changed copyright notice in every .c File
  (added new E-Mail Address and renewed (c))

* changed README and manpage (minor changes)

* moved configuration settings in Makefile up to
  the top of the file

Version 1.3p2
=============

* not using http://host/path style GET requests
  anymore when not contacting an auxiliary proxy

* fixed command line option -v behaviour:
  ffproxy now terminates after displaying the
  version number

* fixed wrong db_path comment in sample.config:
  path must be relative to new root but in no case
  absolute because at first time read of the config
  files ffproxy hasn't dropped its priviliges --
  because *after* reading them it knows that it
  should do

Version 1.3p1
=============

* off by one error (reported by Oliver Kurth)
  [ r->header[i] = (char *) my_alloc(len);
   in request.c ] fixed

* (hopefully) fixed compiling issues under
  linux (take a look at Makefile)

* manpage was installed in wrong location, fixed

--------------------------------------------------
   Forgot sample.config in tar.gz for version 1.3,
   fixed the tar.gz after report from Oliver Kurth
   and uploaded the fixed one instead of the old
   under the same file name on Fri, 2 Aug 2002
--------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3
===========

* complete rewrite

* layout of db/ has changed.  delimited string
  matching was abolished.

* undocumented caching support

Version 1.2
===========

* changed loop protection (now it is
  possible to connect through an arbitrary
  number of ffproxy proxy servers, previously
  LOOP_HEADER had to be edited, which is
  now abolished.  The X-loop header is
  generated by the pid of the master process
  and seconds since the epoch at invocation
  time and therefore can be regarded as
  unique.)

* added configuration file support.  See
  file sample.config.  System wide default
  configuration file is /etc/ffproxy.conf,
  but the user may use the new command
  line option -f to specify the configuration
  file to use.  Note that command line
  options overwrite defaults from
  /etc/ffproxy.conf, but don't overwrite
  user file configurations.  In other words:
  When using -f, other command line options 
  are useless.

* added a few new command line options.
  See manpage or ffproxy -h for details.

* added HTTP HEAD method and changed code
  to recognize different protocol versions

* added logging option to log every request.
  By default, only filtered and incorrect
  requests get logged, as before.

* regular expressions are now pre-compiled
  to tune performance

* fixed some nasty bugs (i.e. error while
  parsing optional host part in URLs. 
  Request was generally blocked, or 
  damaged headers under some circumstances)
  
* Updated manpage and README.

Version 1.1
===========

* added extended regular expression support

* raised MAX_MSG_SIZE in log.c
  (longer URLs got truncated in log output)

* drop_privileges() allocated memory twice
  (forgot to remove that, sorry)
  (Note that this had no effect at all)

* added command line option -D to specify directory
  which contains db/ and html/

* added a manpage -- fproxy(1)

* improved logging

* modified the html/* error files

* updated README file

* URL host is preferred from host in Host header
  (previously host header could overwrite hostname
  found in URL, so using another proxy server
  through this proxy server)

* fixed compiling issues:

  o changed Makefile (users got confused with MY_CFLAGS,
    removed that completely)

  o changed resolve() to return unsigned long since in_addr_t
    is not supported on all systems

Version 1.0
===========

Initial release
